# Project: Analysing The Movie Database(TMDb) Dataset1
 This is a Dataset from the Movie Database. In this analysis, I will be using this data set to find trends between movie genres, the cast, budget and revenue and use this trends to answer quesions such as the kind of genres capable of bringing in the highest and lowest revenues, what amount of budget is required to increase our chances of generating higher revenue, and what genres are highly watched by viewers.
